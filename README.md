## Project description:
A platform for people to trade their video games to others. We use a video game database API (RAWG) to make it easy for people to list their games, auto filling the rest of the information once they type the title. Once a seller lists a game, buyers will be able to find it by searching available games.

## Description:
Sellers will be able to: 
Add video games they want to sell as listings
Add / edit prices
Delete their video game listings
Buyers will be able to:
Search listings by 3 fields: Genre, name, price
View all information about the game listing, including value given by seller

## User Stories
As video game fans, we are looking to design and implement a user friendly web application that allows users to sell and buy video games based on genre, title, and price.
•As a user I want to be able to have a username and password(to sign in and out of the web page).
•As a user I would like to give information on the video game(so when video game being sold they have information on said video game).
•As a user I want to be able to buy and sell(to be able to sell video games I own and buy video games I desire).
•As a user would like to be able to update the prices in which the video games are being sold at(to be able to keep a fair price).
•As a developer we would like to be able to give the user the ability to be able to sell and buy video games.
•As a developer we would like to be able to give the user the ability to buy and sell games based on categories(so the user is able to set them to a category of genre, name, and price).
•As a developer we would like to be able to give the user control over their list of video games they are selling(so that they are able to add or delete games they have already sold).

As a video game listing, each listing:
• is loaded as a thumbnail on the results page
• once selected, a new view/page displays the video game along with all information, including the value given to it by the seller
